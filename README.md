# Linked_Lists
 Linked Lists implementation using C 
Linked List Project in C
This project implements various types of linked lists and associated operations in C. It includes:

Singly Linked List (SLL)
Doubly Linked List (DLL)
Circular Singly Linked List (CSLL)
Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL)
Queue Implementation using Singly Linked List
Stack Implementation using Singly Linked List
Sum of Two Polynomials using Singly Linked Lists
Concatenation of Two Singly Linked Lists

Project Structure
The project is organized into different header files for each type of linked list, and all the functionalities are implemented in linked_list.c.

Files:
Sll.h – Header file for Singly Linked List
Dll.h – Header file for Doubly Linked List
Cll.h – Header file for Circular Singly Linked List
linked_list.c – Main file that implements the logic for all the linked list types and operations

How to Run the Code
1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.Make sure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
3.To compile the code, run the following command:
	gcc linked_list.c Sll.h Dll.h Cll.h -o linked_list.exe
4.After compilation, run the executable using:
	./linked_list.exe

Requirements :
GCC Compiler
Any system with C standard library support

Future Enhancements :
Implementing additional linked list operations.
